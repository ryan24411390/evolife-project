              Semaglutide is a GLP-1 receptor agonist medication originally developed for type 2 diabetes
              that has been proven effective for weight loss. It works by mimicking a hormone that targets
              areas of the brain that regulate appetite and food intake, helping you feel fuller longer
              and reducing cravings.
