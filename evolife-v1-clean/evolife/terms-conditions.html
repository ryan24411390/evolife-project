The Evolife Services</h2><p><strong>THE SERVICES ARE FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. THE SERVICES DO NOT PROVIDE MEDICAL OR HEALTHCARE ADVICE.</strong></p><h3>1. Our Role</h3><p>Evolife does not provide any medical services itself. Depending on your personal situation, state of residence, and evolution of our Services, Evolife may provide: (i) access to general information on health and wellness topics; (ii) access to independent medical groups who provide health care services through the Services (<strong>&quot;Providers&quot;</strong>) who are contracted by certain independent, clinical professional practice groups (collectively, the <strong>&quot;Practices&quot;</strong>); (iii) access to laboratory services performed by third party clinical laboratories (<strong>&quot;Labs&quot;</strong>); (iv) access to prescription fulfillment services offered by third party pharmacies (<strong>“Pharmacies”</strong>); (v) assistance with obtaining insurance coverage from your existing health care plan for the relevant Services; and (vi) access to content from or interactions with in-house or third-party dietitians, health coaches, and trainers.</p><p>We do not control or interfere with the practice of medicine by the Providers and Practices, each of whom is solely responsible for directing the medical care and treatment they provide. Any information or advice received from a Practice comes from the Practice or Provider alone, and not from Evolife. You acknowledge and agree that Evolife is not a healthcare provider and that by using the Services, you are not entering into a doctor-patient or other health care provider-patient relationship with us. By using the Services, you may be entering into a doctor-patient or other health care provider-patient relationship with a Provider and/or one or more Practices. Evolife is not liable for any professional advice obtained from a Practice or Provider via the Services or for any other information obtained on the Services.</p><p>The content of the Services, including, without limitation, text, copy, audio, video, photographs, illustrations, graphics, and other visuals (collectively, the “Evolife Content”), is for informational purposes only and does not constitute professional medical advice, diagnosis, treatment, or recommendations of any kind. You should always seek the advice of a qualified health care professional if you have any questions or concerns you may have regarding your individual needs and any medical conditions. All information provided by Evolife or in connection with any communications supported by Evolife, including, but not limited to, Evolife Content and the communications with Evolife nutritionists and health coaches, is intended to be for general informational purposes only, and is in no way intended to create a physician-patient relationship as defined by state and federal law. The Services are not a substitute for professional medical diagnosis or treatment. Reliance on any information appearing on the Services, whether provided by Evolife, its content providers, nutritionists, health coaches, clients, visitors to the Services, or others, is solely at your own risk. </p><p>Although Evolife may provide assistance with obtaining insurance coverage from your existing health care plan, Evolife does not offer or sell insurance itself.</p><p>Any advice provided by a dietician is nutritional advice, not medical or dietetic advice.</p><p>Certain Services may not be available in all states.</p><h3>2. How the Services Work</h3><p>We will ask you some initial qualifying questions about yourself and your health. These questions were approved by the relevant Practices.  If the answers to those questions meet certain criteria specified by a Practice, the Practice will invite the user to schedule an initial appointment and establish an account on the Practice’s and/or Provider’s own patient portal (the<strong> “Patient Portal”</strong>), which is not operated by Evolife or Evolife’ service providers. The Patient Portal may have the Evolife logo, but it is operated by the Practice, Provider, or its service providers, not us.</p><p>In the Patient Portal, you will answer a more detailed questionnaire designed by the Practice, which will request additional medical information and other personal information.</p><p>Payment, diagnosis, and any provision of telehealth will happen through the Patient Portal and other services operated by the Practice and/Provider or their service providers (collectively with the Patient Portal, the “Healthcare Provider Sites”), not through Evolife’ site. Our fees may appear as a charge from “Thrive Health Group” (instead of “Evolife”).</p><p>Diagnosis or treatment may also require obtaining lab work or prescriptions through Labs and Pharmacies that are not operated by or for Evolife (collectively, “Third Party Suppliers”).</p><p>Your relationship with the Practice, Provider, and Third Party Suppliers, and your use of the Patient Portal other Healthcare Provider Sites, will be governed by the relevant third-party entity’s Additional Terms (as defined in Section 4 below) and are subject to the privacy policies and practices of the relevant third-party entity and its service providers, even though the Evolife logo may appear on the Healthcare Provider Sites.</p><h3>3. Modification of the Terms or the Services</h3><p>We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to update these Terms by posting the updated version and updating the “Last Updated” date at the top of the page.</p><p>Unless you first reject the updated Terms by discontinuing all use of the Evolife Services, sending a notice of termination to cancellation@joinevolife.com, and canceling any subscription you may have by following the procedure at Section 7(c), you will be deemed to accept the changes and they will take effect at the “Update Effective Time,” which is the earlier of: (a) 11:00 a.m. Eastern time on the 31st day after Evolife posts them (or a later date that we specify in the update, if any); (b) your first ever use of a new or changed feature of the Evolife Services that is subject to the updated Terms (for example, your first ever use of a new feature for which the updated Terms contain special provisions), or (c) your taking some other action to specifically accept the updated Terms, such as clicking to accept them.</p><p>You must send the termination notice from the email address associated with your account, or if this is not possible, you must promptly cooperate with us to identify your account. Regardless of the email address you use, you must promptly cooperate with any request from us to authenticate that you are the account holder and that you are the actual sender of the termination notice. You agree to review these Terms periodically to ensure that you are familiar with the most recent version. At your request, following your termination, we will issue you a pro-rated refund for any remaining unused portion of subscription fees you have paid. You are prohibited from using the Evolife Services after sending a notice of termination, except as may be necessary to follow any instructions we may provide via email for authentication of your identity and request. If you violate this requirement and do use the Evolife Services after sending a notice of termination (and before we block your access), your termination notice will be void as if it had never taken effect, and the updated Terms will take effect (or will have taken effect) at the Update Effective Time.</p><p>Any changes to Section 19 (<strong>“Arbitration and Class Action Waiver”</strong>) are also subject to the additional provisions in that section regarding changes to that section.</p><p>Evolife reserves the right at any time to modify, suspend, discontinue, or terminate, temporarily or permanently, the Services (or any part thereof). You agree that Evolife shall not be liable to you for any modification, suspension, or discontinuance of the Services.</p><h3>4. Additional Terms</h3><p>In order to access or purchase certain Services, you may be required to agree and enter into, or acknowledge receipt of, one or more additional agreements, consents, assignments, releases or notices as a condition of accessing, purchasing or receiving those Services (such additional agreements, consents, assignment, releases or notices, collectively as and when furnished and entered into or acknowledged, <strong>&quot;Additional Terms and Conditions&quot;</strong>). </p><p>Such Additional Terms and Conditions may be specific to (a) a supplier of the Services, including a specific or group of Labs, Pharmacies, Practices or Providers, (b) a Service or category of Service or (c) any combination thereof.  In many cases, Evolife is not a party to Additional Terms and Conditions, and you will enter into such Additional Terms and Conditions with a third party such as a Practice or Provider.  You must comply with the Additional Terms and Conditions.</p><p><strong>Pharmacy Services</strong></p><p>By accepting these Terms of Use, you additionally understand and agree that Evolife is not acting as a pharmacy, nor does Evolife control or interfere with any such services.

You will be responsible for all Subscription Fees (plus any applicable taxes and other charges) incurred for the then-current Subscription period.

Arbitration and Class Action Waiver</strong></h3><p><strong>PLEASE READ THIS “ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER” SECTION CAREFULLY, AS IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE OR PARTICIPATE IN A LAWSUIT FILED IN COURT.</strong></p><p><strong>1. Informal Dispute Resolution Procedure</strong></p><p>If a dispute arises between you and Evolife, we are committed to working with you to reach a reasonable resolution. For any such dispute, both parties acknowledge and agree that they will first make a good faith effort to resolve it informally before initiating any formal dispute resolution proceeding in arbitration or otherwise. This requires first sending a written description of the dispute to the other party. For any dispute you initiate, you agree to send the written description of the dispute along with the email address associated with your account, if any, to the following email address: hello@joinevolife.com. For any dispute that Evolife initiates, we will send our written description of the dispute to the email address associated with your Account. The written description must be on an individual basis and provide, at minimum, the following information: your name; a description of the nature or basis of the claim or dispute; and the specific relief sought. If the dispute is not resolved within sixty (60) days after receipt of the written description of the dispute, you and Evolife agree to the further dispute resolution provisions below.</p><p>The above process for an informal dispute resolution process is required before you may commence any formal dispute resolution proceeding. The parties agree that any relevant limitations period and filing fees or other deadlines will be tolled while the parties engage in this informal dispute resolution process.</p><p><strong>2. Mutual Arbitration Agreement</strong></p><p><strong>‍</strong>You and Evolife agree that all claims, disputes, or disagreements that may arise out of your access or use of the Services including without limitation (i) the content available within the Services; (ii) these Terms (including its formation, performance, and breach); or (iii) that in any way relate to the provision or use of the Services, your relationship with Evolife, or any other dispute with Evolife, shall be resolved exclusively through binding arbitration in accordance with this Section 19 (collectively, the “Arbitration Agreement”). This includes claims that arose, were asserted, or involve facts occurring before the existence of this Arbitration Agreement or any prior agreement as well as claims that may arise after the termination of this Arbitration Agreement, in accordance with the notice and opt-out provisions set forth in Section 19(k). This Arbitration Agreement is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) in all respects and evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce. You and Evolife expressly agree that the FAA shall exclusively govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement. If for whatever reason the rules and procedures of the FAA cannot apply, the state law governing arbitration agreements in the state in which you reside shall apply.</p><p>Except as set forth in this Section 19, the arbitrator or arbitration body, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of these Terms and this Arbitration Agreement, including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part thereof are void or voidable, whether a claim is subject to arbitration, and any dispute regarding the payment of administrative or arbitrator fees (including the timing of such payments and remedies for nonpayment). The arbitrator or arbitration body shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity.</p><p>Notwithstanding the parties&#x27; decision to resolve all disputes through arbitration, each party retains the right to (i) elect to have any claims resolved in small claims court on an individual basis for disputes and actions within the scope of such court’s jurisdiction, regardless of what forum the filing party initial chose; (ii) bring an action in state or federal court to protect its intellectual property rights (patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade secrets and other confidential or proprietary information, but not privacy or publicity rights); and (iii) seek a declaratory judgment, injunction, or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction regarding whether a party&#x27;s claims are time-barred or may be brought in small claims court. Seeking such relief shall not waive a party&#x27;s right to arbitration under this agreement, and any filed arbitrations related to any action filed pursuant to this paragraph shall automatically be stayed pending the outcome of such action.</p><p>You and Evolife agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of any federal or state court in Orange County, California in order to compel arbitration, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator; and in connection with any such proceeding, further agree to accept service of process by U.S. mail and hereby waive any and all jurisdictional and venue defenses otherwise available.</p><p>Except as set forth in Section 19(c) below, if any provision of this Arbitration Agreement is found by an arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the arbitrator or court should endeavor to give effect to the parties&#x27; intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions thereof remain in full force and effect.</p><p>THE PARTIES UNDERSTAND THAT ARBITRATION MEANS THAT AN ARBITRATOR AND NOT A JUDGE OR JURY WILL DECIDE THE CLAIM, AND THAT RIGHTS TO PREHEARING EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION AND APPEALS MAY BE LIMITED IN ARBITRATION. YOU HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU AND EVOLIFE ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.</p><p><strong>3. Class Arbitration and Collective Relief Waiver</strong></p><p><strong>‍</strong>YOU AND EVOLIFE ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW, EXCEPT AS SET OUT OTHERWISE IN THIS SECTION 19(c), ANY ARBITRATION SHALL BE CONDUCTED IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY ONLY AND NOT AS A CLASS OR OTHER CONSOLIDATED ACTION AND THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO RESOLVE AN INDIVIDUAL PARTY’S CLAIM, UNLESS EVOLIFE PROVIDES ITS CONSENT TO CONSOLIDATE IN WRITING.</p><p>If there is a final judicial determination that this Section 19(c) is not enforceable as to a particular claim or request for relief, then the parties agree that that particular claim or request for relief may proceed in court but shall be severed and stayed pending arbitration of the remaining claims. This provision does not prevent you or Evolife from participating in a class-wide settlement of claims.</p><p><strong>4. Arbitration Rules</strong></p><p><strong>‍</strong>The arbitration will be administered by National Arbitration and Mediation (“NAM”) and resolved before a single arbitrator. If NAM is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitration provider, but in no event shall any arbitration be administered by the American Arbitration Association. Except as modified by this &quot;Arbitration Agreement&quot; provision, NAM will administer the arbitration in accordance with the NAM Comprehensive Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures, Fees For Disputes When One of the Parties is a Consumer and the Mass Filing Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures in effect at the time any demand for arbitration is filed with NAM, excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class or representative actions. The applicable NAM rules and procedures are available at www.namadr.com or by emailing National Arbitration and Mediation’s Commercial Dept at commercial@namadr.com.</p><p><strong>5. Initiating Arbitration</strong></p><p><strong>‍</strong>Only after the parties have engaged in a good-faith effort to resolve the dispute in accordance with the Informal Dispute Resolution Procedure provision, and only if those efforts fail, then either party may initiate binding arbitration as the sole means to resolve claims using the procedures set forth in the applicable NAM rules. If you are initiating arbitration, a copy of the demand shall also be emailed to hello@joinevolife.com. If Evolife is initiating arbitration, it will serve a copy of the demand to the email address associated with your Account or the email that Evolife has on file for you. The arbitrator has the right to impose sanctions in accordance with the NAM rules and procedures for any frivolous claims or submissions the arbitrator determines have not been filed in good faith, as well as for a party&#x27;s failure to comply with the Informal Dispute Resolution Procedure contemplated by this Arbitration Agreement.</p><p><strong>6. Arbitration Location and Procedure</strong></p><p><strong>‍</strong>If you are a resident of the United States the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside, and if you are not a resident of the United States the arbitration shall be conducted in Orange County, California, United States of America, unless you and Evolife otherwise agree or unless the designated arbitrator determines that such venue would be unreasonably burdensome to any party, in which case the arbitrator shall have the discretion to select another venue. If the amount in controversy does not exceed $10,000 and you do not seek injunctive or declaratory relief, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents you and Evolife submit to the arbitrator, unless the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If the amount in controversy exceeds $10,000 or seeks declaratory or injunctive relief, either party may request (or the arbitrator may determine) to hold a hearing, which shall be via videoconference or telephone conference unless the parties agree otherwise.</p><p>Subject to the applicable NAM rules and procedures, the parties agree that the arbitrator will have the discretion to allow the filing of dispositive motions if they are likely to efficiently resolve or narrow issues in dispute. Unless otherwise prohibited by law, all arbitration proceedings will be confidential and closed to the public and any parties other than you and Evolife (and each of the parties’ authorized representatives and agents), and all records relating thereto will be permanently sealed, except as necessary to obtain court confirmation of the arbitration award (provided that the party seeking confirmation shall seek to file such records under seal to the extent permitted by law).</p><p><strong>7. Batch Arbitration</strong></p><p><strong>‍</strong>To increase the efficiency of administration and resolution of arbitrations, in the event 100 or more similar arbitration demands (those asserting the same or substantially similar facts or claims, and seeking the same or substantially similar relief) presented by or with the assistance or coordination of the same law firm(s) or organization(s) are submitted to NAM against Evolife (“Mass Filing”), the parties agree (i) to administer the Mass Filing in batches of 100 demands per batch (to the extent there are fewer than 100 arbitration demands left over after the batching described above, a final batch will consist of the remaining demands) with only one batch filed, processed, and adjudicated at a time; (ii) to designate one arbitrator for each batch; (iii) to accept applicable fees, including any related fee reduction determined by NAM in its discretion; (iv) that no other demands for arbitration that are part of the Mass Filing may be filed, processed, or adjudicated until the prior batch of 100 is filed, processed, and adjudicated; (v) that fees associated with a demand for arbitration included in a Mass Filing, including fees owed by Evolife and the claimants, shall only be due after your demand for arbitration is included in a set of batch proceedings and that batch is properly designated for filing, processing, and adjudication; and (vi) that the staged process of batched proceedings, with each set including 100 demands, shall continue until each demand (including your demand) is adjudicated or otherwise resolved. Arbitrator selection for each batch shall be conducted to the greatest extent possible in accordance with the applicable NAM rules and procedures for such selection, and the arbitrator will determine the location where the proceedings will be conducted. You agree to cooperate in good faith with Evolife and the arbitration provider to implement such a “batch approach” or other similar approach to provide for an efficient resolution of claims, including the payment of combined reduced fees, set by NAM in its discretion, for each batch of claims. The parties further agree to cooperate with each other and the arbitration provider or arbitrator to establish any other processes or procedures that the arbitration provider or arbitrator believe will provide for an efficient resolution of claims. Any disagreement between the parties as to whether this provision applies or as to the process or procedure for batching shall be resolved by a procedural arbitrator appointed by NAM. This “Batch Arbitration” provision shall in no way be interpreted as increasing the number of claims necessary to trigger the applicability of NAM’s Mass Filing Supplemental Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures or authorizing class arbitration of any kind. Unless Evolife otherwise consents in writing, Evolife does not agree or consent to class arbitration, private attorney general arbitration, or arbitration involving joint or consolidated claims under any circumstances, except as set forth in this subpart (g). If your demand for arbitration is included in the Mass Filing, your claims will remain tolled until your demand for arbitration is decided, withdrawn, or is settled.</p><p>The parties agree that this batching provision is integral to the Arbitration Agreement insofar as it applies to a Mass Filing. If the batching provision in this subpart (g) is found to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, then the entirety of this Arbitration Agreement shall be null and void, and neither you nor Evolife shall be entitled to arbitrate any claim that is a part of the Mass Filing.</p><p><strong>8. Mediation Following First Batch in a Mass Filing.</strong>‍</p><p>The results of the first batch of demands will be given to a NAM mediator selected from an initially proposed group of 5 mediators, with Evolife and the remaining claimants’ counsel being able to strike one mediator each and then rank the remaining mediators and the highest collectively ranked mediator being selected. The selected mediator will try to facilitate a resolution of the remaining demands in the Mass Filing. After the results are provided to the mediator, Evolife, the mediator and the remaining claimants will have 90 days (the “Mediation Period”) to agree on a resolution or substantive methodology for resolving the outstanding demands. If they are unable to resolve the outstanding demands during the Mediation Period, and cannot agree on a methodology for resolving them through further arbitrations, either Evolife or any remaining claimant may opt out of the arbitration process and have the demand(s) proceed in court. Notice of the opt-out will be provided in writing within 60 days of the close of the Mediation Period. If neither Evolife nor the remaining claimants opt out and they cannot agree to a methodology for resolving the remaining demands through further arbitration, the arbitrations will continue with the batching process. Opt out of arbitration under this section shall not be construed as opt out of Section 19(c), “Class Action Waiver.” Absent notice of an opt-out, the arbitrations will proceed in the order determined by the sequential numbers assigned to demands in the Mass Filing.</p><p><strong>9. Arbitrator’s Decision</strong></p><p>The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the applicable NAM rules and procedures. The arbitrator&#x27;s decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator will have the authority to award monetary damages on an individual basis and to grant, on an individual basis, any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual to the extent available under applicable law, the arbitral forum&#x27;s rules, and this Arbitration Agreement. The parties agree that the damages and/or other relief must be consistent with the terms of the &quot;Limitation of Liability&quot; section of these Terms as to the types and the amounts of damages or other relief for which a party may be held liable. No arbitration award or decision will have any preclusive effect as to issues or claims in any dispute with anyone who is not a named party to the arbitration. Attorneys&#x27; fees will be available to the prevailing party in the arbitration only if authorized under applicable substantive law governing the claims in the arbitration.</p><p><strong>10. Fees</strong></p><p><strong>‍</strong>If you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, Company will pay any filing and hearing fees in excess of the first $250 you pay that the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive regardless of the outcome of the arbitration, unless the arbitrator determines that your claim(s) were frivolous or asserted in bad faith, in which case a requirement to pay all arbitration fees (including attorneys’ fees) may be imposed upon you consistent with the Arbitrator’s Rules and the standard for sanctions set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11.</p><p>You are responsible for your own attorneys&#x27; fees unless the arbitration rules and/or applicable law provide otherwise. The parties agree that NAM has discretion to reduce the amount or modify the timing of any administrative or arbitration fees due under NAM’s Rules where it deems appropriate, provided that such modification does not increase the costs to you, and you further agree that you waive any objection to such fee modification. The parties also agree that a good-faith challenge by either party to the fees imposed by NAM does not constitute a default, waiver, or breach of this Arbitration Agreement while such challenge remains pending before NAM, the arbitrator, and/or a court of competent jurisdiction, and that any and all due dates for those fees shall be tolled during the pendency of such challenge.</p><p><strong>11. Right to Opt Out of the Arbitration Agreement</strong></p><p><strong>‍</strong>IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO BE BOUND BY THE “ARBITRATION AGREEMENT” AS SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION 15, THEN: (1) you must notify Evolife in writing within thirty (30) days of the date that you first accessed or otherwise become subject to this Arbitration Agreement (or any subsequent changes to the provisions of the section titled “Arbitration and Class Action Waiver”); (2) your written notification must be mailed to 17322 Murphy Ave, Irvine CA 92816 or emailed to hello@joinevolife.com; and (3) your written notification must include (a) your name, (b) your address, and (c) a clear statement that you wish to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. If you do not timely opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, such action shall constitute mutual acceptance of the terms of these “Arbitration and Class Action Waiver” provisions by you and Evolife.</p><p><strong>12. Changes to this Arbitration Agreement</strong></p><p><strong>‍</strong>Regardless of the Update Effective Time determined pursuant to Section 3 for the rest of the Terms, the Update Effective Time for changes to this Arbitration Agreement is 11:00 a.m. Eastern time on the 31st day after Evolife posts them (or a later date that we specify in the update, if any). Any such changes will apply to all claims not yet filed as of the Update Effective Time for this Arbitration Agreement. If you reject any such changes by opting out of the Arbitration Agreement, you may exercise your right to a trial by jury or judge, as permitted by applicable law, but any prior existing agreement to arbitrate disputes under a prior version of the Arbitration Agreement will not apply to claims not yet filed. If you do not agree to a change we make to this Arbitration Agreement, you may opt out by providing notice as described in Section 19(k), or you may terminate the Terms as described in Section 3.</p><h3><strong>20. Venue and Governing Law</strong></h3><p>For any dispute not subject to arbitration or under the jurisdiction of a small claims court, you and Evolife agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of any venue in the federal and state courts located in Orange County, California. You further agree to accept service of process by mail, and hereby waive any and all jurisdictional and venue defenses otherwise available.</p><p>The Terms and the relationship between you and Evolife shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to conflict of law provisions.</p><h3><strong>21.
