        "description": "This synergistic nootropic stack combines Semax—a synthetic ACTH fragment with powerful cognitive-enhancing properties—with Selank, an anxiolytic peptide that reduces stress while supporting mental performance. Developed by Russian scientists, both peptides have extensive research demonstrating neuroprotective, cognitive, and stress-reducing effects without the side effects of traditional stimulants or anxiolytics.",

            "Semax increases BDNF and enhances neuroplasticity for improved learning and memory",
            "Selank modulates GABAergic and serotonergic systems for stress reduction without sedation",
